The Residential Variation Statistics (EVR) is an annual report compiled by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) which covers all residential changes reported by individuals when there is a change in their municipality of residence.

This project begins with a descriptive analysis of this source. (Chapter 2)

Then proceeds to its aggregation with other demographic and territorial variables gathered from census and municipal registers. (Chapter 3)

Applying classification trees, as a supervised learning method, an attempt is made to detect the most influential patterns of migration flows between Spanish municipalities. (Chapter 4)

The project has been developed first during the spring and summer of 2021 as a final dissertation of<br>[Master in Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ifca.es/).
